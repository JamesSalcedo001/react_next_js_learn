/*

note: Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you the building blocks to create fast, full stack web applications

** building blocks of web apps

note: a few things to consider when building modern apps:

- user interface: how users will consume and interact with your app

- routing: how users navigate between diff parts of your app

- data fetching: where data lives and how to get it

- rendering: when and where you render static or dynamic content

- integrations: what third party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them

- infrastructure: where you deploy, store, and run your app code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc)

- performance: how to optimize your app for end users

- scalability: how your app adapts to your team, data, and traffic grow

- dev experience: your team's experience building and maintaining your application

for each part of the app, you need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools such as packages, libraries, and frameworks
