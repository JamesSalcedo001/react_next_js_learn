// Creating and nesting components

/* React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. a component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. React components: JavaScript functions that return markup:


ex:

    // declaring a button

    function MyButton() {
        return (
            <button>I'm a button</button>
        )
    }



    // nesting a button into another component

    export default function MyApp() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
                <MyButton />
            </div>
        );
    }


    // note: React component names start with capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowwercase

    // note: The export default keywords specify the main component in the file.


    // writing markup with JSX
